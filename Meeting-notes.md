# Meeting 01.11.2021 14::00
The first meeting of the group was held via discord. The goal of the meeting is to decide what features we want to include in the dungeon crawler and start writing the project plan. A google drive document was created to start writing the project plan. A lot of the meeting was spent discussing what features we want to implement in the dungeon crawler and adding them to the project plan.  

**Participants**: 
1. Jonas
2. Oskar
3. Henrik
4. Mikael 

## Summary of works
1. Jonas
   Tried to understand how CMake and SFML works with little success. 

2. Mikael
   Read about SFML but hasn't got it working 

3. Henrik 
   Found a github repository with instructions how to use SFML which could be useful.

4. Oskar
   Overview of dungeon crawlers and looked a bit into making the graphics. 


## Challenges

1. None of the group members have experience working with the libraries which we want to use. 
2. It is still unclear how time consuming it will be to implement additional features. 

## Actions
1. Everyone should review what has been written to the project plan and make additions. 
2. New meeting 2.11 at 1 pm when the assistant has hopefully answered our questions. 

## Project status 
Nothing concrete has been done to the project yet. We started writing the project plan and chose what features we want to implement in the game. Some general information about the project was also added to the project.  

### TODOs
1. Jonas: Ask the teaching assitant if WSL should be used and how we should get SFML working. We also need to make sure that our development environment is compatible with the testing done on the school computers. 
2. Henrik: Configure GitLab to have correct labels and boards. 
3. Oskar: Watch tutorial to get more familiar with git.
4. Mikael: Same as Oskar.
