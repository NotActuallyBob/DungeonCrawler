# Meeting Notes
In this file, you are required to take notes for your weekly meetings.
In each meeting, you are required to discuss:

2. Are there challenges or problems? Discuss the possible solutions
3. Plan for the next week for everyone
4. Deviations and changes to the project plan, if any


# Meeting 01.11.2021 14::00
The first meeting of the group was held via discord. The goal of the meeting is to decide what features we want to include in the dungeon crawler and start writing the project plan. A google drive document was created to start writing the project plan. A lot of the meeting was spent discussing what features we want to implement in the dungeon crawler and adding them to the project plan.

**Participants**:
1. Jonas
2. Oskar
3. Henrik
4. Mikael

## Summary of works
1. Jonas
   Tried to understand how CMake and SFML works with little success.

2. Mikael
   Read about SFML but hasn't got it working

3. Henrik
   Found a github repository with instructions how to use SFML which could be useful.

4. Oskar
   Overview of dungeon crawlers and looked a bit into making the graphics.


## Challenges

1. None of the group members have experience working with the libraries which we want to use.
2. It is still unclear how time consuming it will be to implement additional features.

## Actions
1. Everyone should review what has been written to the project plan and make additions.
2. New meeting 2.11 at 1 pm when the assistant has hopefully answered our questions.

## Project status
Nothing concrete has been done to the project yet. We started writing the project plan and chose what features we want to implement in the game. Some general information about the project was also added to the project.

### TODOs
1. Jonas: Ask the teaching assitant if WSL should be used and how we should get SFML working. We also need to make sure that our development environment is compatible with the testing done on the school computers.
2. Henrik: Configure GitLab to have correct labels and boards.
3. Oskar: Watch tutorial to get more familiar with git.
4. Mikael: Same as Oskar.

# Meeting 02.11.2021 13::00
The goal of this meeting was to get SFML working for every group member. We held the meeting in discord as all future meetings will also be held. We got SFML working on 3 out of 4 group members computers. We are hoping to get the last computer set up with SFML later this day. We also decided to use Sourcetree to interact with git. Henrik had used this software earlier so he educated the rest of the group on how to use it.

**Participants**:
1. Jonas
2. Oskar
3. Henrik
4. Mikael

## Summary of works
1. Jonas
   Got SFML working and was able to compile and run a sample program.

2. Mikael
   Got SFML working and was able to compile and run a sample program. Also sourcetree is installed and working.

3. Henrik
   Got SFML working and was able to compile and run a sample program.

4. Oskar
   Was nearly able to get SFML working during the meeting. Will probably get it working later today.


## Challenges

1. Sourcetree seems to want VSC closed when operating.
2. Sourcetree also does not correctly show which rows have been added, modified and removed.

## Actions
1. Everyone should install SFML correctly
2. Everyone should install sourcetree correctly

## Project status
We now have SFML working on most of our computers. Next time we can focus on thinking about class relations and working further on our project plan.

### TODOs
1. Jonas: Install sourcetree. Investigate sourcetree for better functionality
2. Henrik: Get sourcetree setup correctly. Investigate sourcetree for better functionality
3. Oskar: Get SFML working and install sourcetree. Investigate sourcetree for better functionality
4. Mikael: Investigate sourcetree for better functionality.
